# Speech-Recognition
A Deep Neural Network to function as part of an end to end Automatic Speech Recognition pipeline

This capstone project was part of my NLP nano-degree offered by Udacity, in collaboration with Amazon Alexa and IBM Watson. In this project, I have developed a Deeper Neural Network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline! The completed pipeline accepts raw audio as input and returns a predicted transcription of the spoken language (English). The model was trained on a subset of LibriSpeech dataset which contains 1000 hours of speech derived from English audiobooks.
